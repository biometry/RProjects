# RProjects
small class projects that may be nice to read about

At the department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis, we offer a class "R projects" every winter term. It serves as a sandbox for students to learn using R in a more sophisticated way, or for large data, or for automatised activities and so forth. Here we share some of the results from that class.

Each project has its own subfolder. Typically all data and R-code are provided there.
